9 improve the email text wrapping 


DONE
1 if i update the contract start date manually, the monthly paid column need to follow, it will override the day that i set the pilot number

2 when i run copy new entries from form, it should show me a modal of what it did, how many cells were populated

3 when i run check & send renewal reminder, it should show me a modal of what it did, how many emails were sent

4 when i run sync renewals from renewal status, it should show me a modal of what it did, how many companies email renewals were processed

5 when i run archive terminated customer, it should show me a modal of what it did, how many companies were archived.

6 for any last minutes changes of terminated customer, customer didn't reply and their contract end date have lapsed, and companies decided to renew at the last minute, i should have a way to bring back these companies from the archived sheet back to the tracker sheet with all data intact from the row. and also follow the sorting rule from oldest to newest.
example if customer start their subscription from Feb-2024 until Jan 2027, this companies should be sorted from their oldest start date

7 i need a way to sort all the customer contract start date from oldest to newest and all their histories intact
